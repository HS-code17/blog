# My Experience

My first experience with scraping websites came with scraping olx site to find apartments. I was able to do so using beautiful soup and print out phone numbers. 


My next goal is to create a script that scrapes sites from the terminal. Maybe I would want to create it in JS or another language not sure yet.
