# Website Launch

After dabbling for a while with the idea of using a static site generator. I decided I'm going to give it a try. I liked the idea of having a structured way to organize my posts and pages. This allows more room to focus on the learning. 

The theme is originally from Micah Cowell, and I will try improve it. I want to add some cool features to keep track of posts. As well as add a comment section.
