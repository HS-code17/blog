# This post is just going to be about the general things I've learned this week

So I started using vim but it seems like it has a high learning curve, but once
you learn how to properly use it. It can make your life much easier.

I'm learning how to navigate files; so today I learned how to open a new file and some other commands attribute to it


{% highlight vim %}
Vim provides these commands for searching files:
    :grep
    :lgrep
    :vimgrep
    :lvimgrep

:e %:h/filename (creates a new file)

:w (you have to save it or write)

:vsp newfile ( create a new file and split screen in half)

:sp (horizontal split)

:cd %:p:h ( this will create the file in the directory of the file in which you opened vim. To adjust for this, you can change the current working directory as follows)

:pwd (this will create the file in the directory of the file in which you opened vim. To adjust for this, you can change the current working directory as follows)

:u or u (undo in vim)

:cd (you can navigate to the file desired)


{% endhighlight %}


## Syllogism

1. : a deductive scheme of a formal argument consisting of a major and a minor premise and a conclusion (as in "every virtue is laudable; kindness is a virtue; therefore kindness is laudable")
