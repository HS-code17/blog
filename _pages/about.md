"The thing I really enjoy about programming is just the fact you really can tell the computer exactly what to do and it will do what you tell it and nothing more" 
[Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5S9LIT-hdc)

I totally resonate with what he is saying. I think that is what attracts me the most about programming. Although, it is still very challenging to be able to write any piece of code without the help of others.But there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel.

I hope one day, I can give back to the community that helped me learn about programming.
